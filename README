Here is my C++ wrapper for Chipmunk Physics.  This is a very thin
layer above the chipmunk itself, mostly for convenience of automatic
construction\destruction.

Features:
 * chipmunk in C++ style
 * Kustom Accessorz functions // not a typo, intended :P
 * use of powerful Boost's smart pointers (the wrapper is
   based upon the smart pointers, so if you dont like boost
   or cant use it then the wrapper is probably useless for you)
 * inline implementation in headers for minimal performance
   impact of the wrapper and convenience

wrapped structures(with corresponding functions):
cpBody
cpShape
cpSpace
cpJoint
cpBB

IMPORTANT NOTE: Be sure to place include safeguards to chipmunk.h!

This wrapper is intended for free public use, there arent any
limitations, so feel free to download, modify, use it however you like
8)

If you have any useful suggestions\feature
request\modifications\patches post them here, and I will update my
code.

I did NOT test every piece of the code, so there could be a few
bugs. But everything I did test is working. I'll be glad to hear about
the bugs if you find any 8)

The wrapper has its most use in simple games\prototypes\tests where
you dont need a complicated physics framework for the chipmunk
physics.

The wrapper 'assumes' chipmunk version 4.0.2, which means I didn't
test it with other versions.
